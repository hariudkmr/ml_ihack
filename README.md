# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: Keyword Spotting (KWS)

Audio Keyword Spotting code on PSoC&trade; 6 MCU based on a custom Machine Learning model.

This application reads the PCM audio data from PDM mic and performs feature extraction and inferencing based on the above ML model. The result is currently displayed on the UART terminal.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.4 or later (tested with v2.4)
- Board support package (BSP) required version: 2.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSoC&trade; 6 MCU](https://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm® embedded compiler v9.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; compiler v6.13 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ compiler v8.42.2 (`IAR`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; prototyping kit](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) (`CY8CPROTO-062-4343W`)

## Hardware setup

This example requires no additioanl configuration.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools to run. But python installation is good to have for debugging purposes.


## Import the code example

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

   2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

      On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

      **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work. 

   3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

      Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

   4. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

      For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

   5. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

   Also, look at [KBA225201 - Importing Code Example into ModusToolbox IDE](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/Importing-Code-Example-into-ModusToolbox-IDE-KBA225201/ta-p/250475) for a guide on importing projects on ModusToolbox.


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the terminal application displays the code example title and the inferencing output.

5. Speak the below keywords into the PDM mic present on the kit (either left mic or right mic depending on the setting of the `PDM_MODE` macro in *source/audio_task.h*). Default is *right*.

   **Keywords list:** on, off

6. Check the inferencing output on the terminal screen. Apart from the keywords above, silence is another class.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
